# Mondrian Project

## Description

The Mondrian Project is a simple HTML and CSS representation inspired by the works of Piet Mondrian, a Dutch painter known for his abstract geometric compositions. This project uses CSS Grid to create a visually balanced layout that mimics Mondrian's signature style.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Grid Layout)

## Features

- A grid-based layout that mimics Mondrian's famous abstract art style.
- Uses primary colors (red, blue, yellow) along with black, white, and gray.
- Responsive design that centers the artwork on the page.

## Project Structure


## Installation & Usage

- Clone the repository or download the `index.html` file.
- Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
- Observe the Mondrian-inspired grid layout centered on the page.

## How It Works

- The grid-container is set to a 748px x 748px square with gaps to mimic Mondrianâ€™s black grid lines.
- Grid items are assigned different colors and sizes using grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows.
- Some elements span multiple rows or columns to create an asymmetrical yet harmonious design.

## Customization

- Modify the `.grid-container` grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns to experiment with different layouts.
- Change the background colors in the `.fst`, `.snd`, `.rd`, etc., classes to explore different color palettes.
